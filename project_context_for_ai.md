# AI Integration Strategy for Hebrew University Law Faculty: Project Context Document

**Document Type:** Context Injection for LLM Collaboration  
**Target Audience:** AI Agents (Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT, etc.)  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** December 29, 2025  
**Language:** English

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This document provides comprehensive context for an AI-driven strategic initiative to integrate artificial intelligence into legal education at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem Faculty of Law. The project is led by Omer Reish (3rd-year law student, honors program) in partnership with Shaked, with support from Associate Dean Renana Kedar and strategic advisor Avi Asban (DNAidea consulting).

**Current Status:** Post-initial stakeholder meeting. Received "half green light" from Associate Dean. Deadline ~December 21, 2025 for detailed research proposal.

**Core Problem:** An accelerating gap between what students need from academia and what it provides, with the defining characteristic being **pace** — the speed at which this gap widens.

**Proposed Solution:** Three-phase strategic intervention:
1. **Comprehensive Modeling** (Q1 2025) — Deep empirical research into student AI usage patterns
2. **Faculty Training** (Q2 2025) — Capability building for instructors
3. **Tool Development** (Q3-Q4 2025) — Law-specific AI infrastructure

---

## 1. PROJECT GENESIS & STRATEGIC CONTEXT

### 1.1 The Catalyst

The project emerged from a convergence of three observations:

1. **Global Trend:** 86% of students worldwide use AI in their studies (Digital Education Council, 2024), with UK showing 92% adoption rate in 2025 (HEPI/Kortext survey)

2. **Israeli Policy Vacuum:** No Israeli law faculty has published AI usage guidelines; Council for Higher Education (CHE) has issued no national directives for student AI use

3. **Legal Education Specificity:** Legal AI tools exhibit 58-88% hallucination rates in legal queries (Stanford/Yale 2024), creating unique risks not present in other disciplines

### 1.2 The Inflection Point

A December 10, 2025 meeting with Associate Dean Renana Kedar produced what Omer characterizes as a "half green light" — genuine interest in understanding the phenomenon through research, but skepticism toward technological solutions and explicit concerns about faculty role preservation.

**Critical Quote from Renana:**
> "I really don't know. This is exactly what we need to discover — what we don't know about the students."

This statement became the strategic pivot: the project must begin with discovery, not prescription.

### 1.3 Omer's Educational Philosophy & Vision

This project is not merely a technical integration initiative. It is grounded in a fundamental philosophical stance about the purpose and future of higher education in an age of abundant information.

#### The Core Principle: "Meta Over Content"

**Central Thesis:** In an era where knowledge is infinitely accessible, the value of education shifts from **possession of information** to **mastery of thinking processes**.

The traditional academic model optimized for a world of information scarcity:
- Knowledge was rare, expensive, controlled
- "Smart" meant memorizing vast amounts of information
- Career advantage came from exclusive access to expertise
- Faculty role: Gatekeepers of scarce knowledge

The AI revolution renders this model obsolete:
- Knowledge is abundant, free, instantly accessible
- "Smart" means knowing what questions to ask and how to evaluate answers
- Career advantage comes from judgment, creativity, synthesis, critical thinking
- Faculty role must transform: From gatekeepers to **navigators**

**Educational Implication:** Academia must pivot from teaching **what to know** to teaching **how to think, question, discern, and create**.

#### AI as Cognitive Amplifier, Not Replacement

Omer's position: AI is fundamentally a **tool for thought augmentation**, not a substitute for human cognition.

**Analogy:** Just as calculators didn't eliminate the need for mathematical thinking but freed humans to focus on higher-order problem-solving, AI should free students to engage in deeper analytical work by handling routine cognitive tasks.

**The Distinction:**
- **Bad AI Use:** Outsourcing thinking itself (passive consumption of AI outputs)
- **Good AI Use:** Amplifying human thinking capacity (AI as intellectual sparring partner, research accelerator, writing coach, blind-spot detector)

**Pedagogical Consequence:** The question is not "Should students use AI?" but rather "How do we teach students to use AI in ways that develop, rather than atrophy, their cognitive capabilities?"

This requires explicit instruction in:
1. **Delegation** — Discerning which tasks benefit from AI assistance vs. which require unaided human work
2. **Prompting** — Formulating precise questions and instructions (a skill in itself)
3. **Discernment** — Critically evaluating AI outputs (detecting hallucinations, logical gaps, bias)
4. **Integration** — Synthesizing AI-generated material with original thought
5. **Responsibility** — Maintaining intellectual ownership and ethical accountability

#### The Faculty Transformation Challenge

The shift from content-delivery to cognitive skill-building requires a radical reconceptualization of the faculty role:

**From Gatekeeper to Navigator:**

| Traditional Role | Transformed Role |
|------------------|------------------|
| Transmit knowledge | Cultivate thinking skills |
| Control access to information | Guide navigation through information abundance |
| Test memorization | Assess judgment and synthesis |
| Detect "cheating" (unauthorized help) | Teach discernment (evaluating help quality) |
| Maintain authority through expertise | Maintain authority through pedagogical design |

**The Emotional Challenge:** This transformation is psychologically threatening to many faculty members:
- Fear of becoming "replaceable" if knowledge transmission is no longer central
- Anxiety about students "knowing more" about AI tools
- Uncertainty about how to teach skills they themselves are still developing
- Concern that AI undermines the struggle-through-difficulty that builds competence

**Omer's Insight:** This is why only **empirical evidence showing the depth of the gap** (Phase 1 modeling) can create the cognitive shock necessary to motivate change. Faculty need to see that students are already operating in a different reality — and that the question is not "whether" but "how" the institution responds.

#### The Stakes: Academic Relevance in the AI Era

**The Central Question:** What is the purpose of legal education if information is free and abundant?

**Omer's Answer:** 
- NOT to transfer legal doctrine (available via AI query)
- NOT to train memorization (irrelevant in open-book, AI-accessible practice)
- BUT to develop **meta-cognitive legal thinking:**
  - Issue-spotting ability (seeing what's legally relevant in messy facts)
  - Analogical reasoning (applying precedent to novel situations)
  - Adversarial thinking (anticipating counter-arguments)
  - Ethical judgment under uncertainty
  - Client communication and persuasive writing
  - **Critical AI literacy** (knowing when AI helps, when it hallucinates, when it misleads)

**The Risk:** If law schools continue teaching as if AI doesn't exist:
- Graduates enter practice unprepared for AI-saturated firms
- Students develop "wild" AI habits without institutional guidance
- The profession's trust in academic preparation erodes
- Competitive institutions that adapt will attract top students and faculty

**The Opportunity:** Hebrew University Faculty of Law could become the **national leader** in AI-integrated legal education:
- First comprehensive student AI literacy program in Israel
- Model for other faculties (law and beyond)
- Research contribution to global literature on AI pedagogy
- Enhanced graduate outcomes (employers value AI-competent lawyers)

#### Why This Philosophy Matters for AI Agents Supporting This Project

Understanding Omer's philosophical foundation is critical for providing aligned support:

1. **Recommendations should advance meta-cognitive skill development**, not just efficiency
2. **Tools should be framed as cognitive amplifiers**, not shortcuts
3. **Faculty transformation should be presented as elevation**, not replacement
4. **Research should uncover both problematic and productive AI usage patterns**
5. **Policy recommendations should enable sophisticated AI use**, not ban it

This is not a project about "bringing AI into law school." It is a project about **fundamentally rethinking what legal education is for** in an age when the scarcity of information no longer constrains learning.

## 2. PROBLEM DEFINITION (IN DEPTH)

### 2.1 The Three-Dimensional Gap

The problem is not singular but compound, manifesting across three axes:

#### Gap #1: Usage Gap
**Observable Reality:** Students use AI extensively (estimated 70%+ in Israel based on HIT 2023 survey of 700 students), but institutional awareness lags dramatically.

**Evidence:**
- 86% global student usage vs. 14-35% non-usage (varies by country)
- 25% daily usage, 54% weekly usage
- Text generation usage in UK **doubled** from 30% to 64% within one year (2024-2025)
- 88% use AI for assessments (UK, 2025)

**Manifestation in Law:** 
- No Israeli law faculty has published AI-specific student guidelines
- Faculty members operate on assumptions that may be off by orders of magnitude
- Students develop "wild" usage patterns without institutional guidance

#### Gap #2: Relevance Gap
**Observable Reality:** Legal profession has rapidly adopted AI; legal education remains largely silent.

**Evidence:**
- 100% of leading law firms use AI tools (Harvey AI, Westlaw CoCounsel, Lexis+ AI)
- ABA issued Formal Opinion 512 (July 2024) — first ethical guidance on generative AI
- 55% of U.S. law schools offer dedicated AI courses (ABA survey, 2024)
- 69% updated academic integrity policies (ABA survey, 2024)

**Israeli Context:**
- Israeli Bar Association: No published AI guidance for legal training
- Hebrew University Faculty of Law: No AI policy despite Lab for Algorithmic Governance research activity
- Tel Aviv University (Buchmann Faculty): Pioneering LLB track with AI/Data Science — first in Israel

**The Stakes:** Graduates enter the profession lacking AI literacy and critical verification skills essential for legal practice.

#### Gap #3: Institutional Capability Gap
**Observable Reality:** Faculty members lack incentives, training, and practical knowledge about AI tools.

**Root Causes (identified through stakeholder analysis):**
1. **No Incentive:** Tenure, comfort, lack of measurement systems
2. **No Training:** No accessible upskilling programs
3. **No Knowledge:** Practical unfamiliarity with capabilities and limitations
4. **Status Anxiety:** Fear of "the student knowing more than me"
5. **Integrity Framing:** AI perceived primarily as "cheating tool" rather than learning amplifier

**Consequence:** Only deep **cognitive shock** — empirical evidence of the usage-reality gap — can motivate behavioral change (per Avi Asban strategic insight).

### 2.2 The Pace Problem

**Key Strategic Insight:** The defining characteristic is not the existence of gaps but their **acceleration**.

Per Avi Asban's framing:
> "The problem isn't that academia is doing nothing — it's the pace at which the gap is widening."

**Temporal Dynamics:**
- AI iteration cycle: **months**
- Academic change cycle: **years**
- Each academic year that passes widens the gap between student reality and institutional capacity

**Analogy (Avi Asban):** This is "Digitization 2.0" — comparable in magnitude to the printing press revolution, where the emphasis shifts from **possession of knowledge** to **use of knowledge**.

## 3. STAKEHOLDER ECOSYSTEM

### 3.1 Primary Stakeholders

#### Renana Kedar — Associate Dean (Primary Decision-Maker)
**Role:** Deputy Dean, Faculty of Law, Hebrew University  
**Positioning:** Teaches seminar on AI; described by Omer as potentially "revolutionary"  
**Actual Behavior (Post-Meeting):**
- Interested in **modeling/research** (understanding the phenomenon)
- Skeptical of **tools** ("This sounds like a startup")
- Silent on **training**
- Concerned about faculty role ("Maybe instead of investing in study buddies — just start attending lectures")

**Critical Misalignment:** Initial hypothesis assumed ideological willingness to lead change. Reality: Renana operates from **institutional-role framing** and seeks **concrete solutions to existing problems**, not philosophical transformation.

**Key Quote:**
> "It's not my job to prepare 'study buddies' for students."

**Strategic Implication:** Modeling phase must generate evidence that creates institutional urgency, not just pedagogical interest.

#### Omer Reish — Project Lead
**Background:**
- 3rd-year law student, interdisciplinary honors program (Law, Economics, Philosophy)
- GPA: 89.36 (Year 1)
- FoodWise hackathon winner (Law × Climate track)
- AI power user with meta-level understanding
- ADHD — requires structured information management

**Positioning:** Bridge between traditional legal institution and AI innovation

**Strengths:** Analytical capabilities, critical thinking, conceptualization, creativity, pressure performance, technological literacy, rapid self-learning, interdisciplinary synthesis

**Challenges:** Information organization under volume, theoretical-to-applied conversion under time pressure, distinguishing signal from noise, execution pacing

**Aspiration:** McKinsey career track

#### Shaked — Co-Lead
**Role:** Partner, described as "CTO" in team dynamics  
**Background:** Technology and project management experience  
**Function in December 10 Meeting:** Interrupted Omer's narrative drift to present concrete three-part proposal, acting as "executive" to Omer's "technologist"

### 3.2 Advisory Layer

#### Avi Asban — Strategic Advisor (DNAidea)
**Contribution:** Reframed the entire strategic approach in December 2, 2025 consultation

**Key Strategic Pivots:**
1. **Problem Reframing:** From "academia not doing anything" to "pace of gap expansion"
2. **Student Instrumentality:** Students are data sources, not primary audience — the shock mechanism for faculty
3. **Theory of Change:** Only empirical evidence creating cognitive dissonance will drive action
4. **Depth Requirement:** Superficial surveys insufficient; need in-depth interviews and behavioral mapping

**Philosophical Contribution:** "Printing Press 2.0" framing — knowledge shifts from scarce/owned to abundant/applied

#### Keren Atinger — Stakeholder (Role TBD)
**Status:** Meeting held December 19, 2025  
**Documentation:** Meeting record exists but not yet processed

### 3.3 Institutional Layer

**Hebrew University Faculty of Law**
- **Current AI Activity:** Lab for Algorithmic Governance (research focus)
- **Current Student Policy:** None published
- **Positioning:** Potential to be first Israeli law faculty with comprehensive AI framework

**Comparative Context:**
- **Tel Aviv (Buchmann):** First LLB+AI/Data Science track in Israel
- **Bar-Ilan:** Most comprehensive AI policy among Israeli universities (disclosure requirement, default permission)
- **Global Leaders:** Harvard, Stanford, Columbia (U.S.); Oxford, Cambridge, LSE (UK) — all have published detailed policies

---

## 4. THEORY OF CHANGE

### 4.1 Causal Logic

```
IF faculty members see empirical evidence of the depth of student AI usage
AND they understand the gap between their assumptions and reality
THEN they will experience cognitive shock that disrupts resistance to change
THEN they will be willing to adopt tools and training
THEN the faculty can lead the transformation rather than react to it
```

### 4.2 Mechanism of Change

**Phase 1: Deep Modeling (Data Collection)**
- 30-50 in-depth interviews with students across all years
- Mapping of daily AI usage routines throughout degree progression
- Identification of usage archetypes (from "never" to "power user")
- Quantification of gap between actual usage and institutional assumptions

**Expected Output:** Research report with shocking findings

**Phase 2: Reflective Shock (Evidence Presentation)**
- Presentation of findings to faculty and administration
- Exposure of gap depth
- Cognitive dissonance creation

**Expected Output:** Recognition of relevance crisis

**Phase 3: Crisis Recognition (Institutional Readiness)**
- Understanding that inaction = drift toward irrelevance
- Psychological preparation for change

**Expected Output:** Willingness to act

**Phase 4: Institutional Action (Capability Building)**
- Tool adoption
- Faculty training programs
- Policy development

**Expected Output:** Internal capability

### 4.3 Critical Assumption Testing

**Assumptions to Validate:**

| Assumption | Risk if Wrong | Validation Method |
|------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Faculty will be shocked by the data | If not → need alternative persuasion mechanism | Pilot findings presentation |
| Administration will act on evidence | If not → need external pressure | Stakeholder pre-alignment |
| Usage gap is significant across student types | If not → argument weakens | Diverse sampling |
| Good tools will be sufficient | If not → also need incentives | Parallel incentive analysis |
| Modeling will yield authentic picture | If not → need better methodology | Methodological rigor |

4. **Diligence:** Ethical responsibility

**UNESCO AI Competency Frameworks** (Sept 2024):
- **For Students:** 12 competencies across 4 dimensions (human-centered mindset, ethics, techniques, design)
- **For Teachers:** 15 competencies for professional development

**Bloom's Taxonomy Revised for AI** (Oregon State, 2024):
- Higher-order skills (Create, Evaluate) emphasize uniquely human capabilities
- Lower-order skills (Remember, Understand) can be more AI-supported
- Pedagogy must shift accordingly

## 8. STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS FOR AI AGENT SUPPORT

### 8.1 User (Omer) Working Style

**Strengths to Leverage:**
- McKinsey-style analytical frameworks (MECE, Pyramid Principle, SCR)
- Multi-stakeholder perspective switching
- Hypothesis-driven investigation
- Evidence-based argumentation
- Gap-based framing

**ADHD Accommodations:**
- Structured outputs with clear next actions
- Chunked information (avoid dense paragraphs)
- Visual hierarchy
- Modular outputs for easy updating

**Preferred Output Formats:**
- Markdown for documents
- Action Titles (complete sentences) for headers
- Tables for comparisons
- Display math ($$) for equations in Hebrew RTL contexts

### 8.2 Document Production Preferences

**When Creating Documents:**
- Lead with conclusion (BLUF - Bottom Line Up Front)
- Use Pyramid Principle structure
- Every header = Action Title (assertion with insight)
- Professional Hebrew for academic stakeholders
- English for international context or AI collaboration
- McKinsey-grade presentation standards when needed

**File Management:**
- Primary workspace: `/Users/omerreish/בינה מלאכותית באקדמיה`
- GitHub: https://github.com/omerreish-lgtm/AI-in-Academia
- Final outputs: Copy to `/mnt/user-data/outputs` for user access

### 8.3 Interaction Protocols

**When Omer Says:**
- **"פרוטוקול [X]"** → Execute specific learning/analysis protocol (see user preferences)
- **"SIMPLE [topic]"** → Break down complex concept to accessible language
- **"LAYER [topic]"** → Structure learning in progressive complexity levels
- **"WHY [topic]"** → Frame relevance to exam/career/project goals
- **"STUCK"** → Provide immediate problem-solving support

**When Supporting Research:**
- Prioritize ruthlessly (80/20 rule)
- Challenge assumptions constructively ("obligation to dissent")
- Synthesize, don't summarize ("So what?" cascade)
- Apply multi-stakeholder lens (student/faculty/institutional/professional)

### 8.4 Critical Context for Decision-Making

**Current Constraint:** ~48 hours until Renana deadline (December 21, 2025)

**Stakeholder Psychology:**
- Renana values **concrete methodology** over **philosophical vision**
- She operates from **institutional role** framing, not ideological transformation
- Research = credible entry point; Tools = perceived as threatening to faculty
- She explicitly stated: *"I really don't know... what we don't know about students"*

**Strategic Imperative:** 
The Research Design Document must position Omer & Shaked as **credible research partners** who will generate **actionable institutional intelligence**, not as "enthusiastic students with a startup idea."
